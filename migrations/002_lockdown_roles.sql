-- Migration: Database Role Security Hardening
-- Purpose: Implement least-privilege database roles for tenant isolation security
-- 
-- Creates separate owner and application roles:
-- - venuine_owner: Owns tables, runs migrations, has full schema control
-- - venuine_app: Limited application role with NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS
--
-- Security Impact:
-- - Prevents application from bypassing Row Level Security (RLS)
-- - Limits privilege escalation if application is compromised
-- - Enforces database-level tenant isolation guarantees
